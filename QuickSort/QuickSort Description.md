QuickSort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithum that chooses a element(pivot point), and put all integer larger on the right of the pivot point and vice versa. The process repeats itself for the left and right array untill the size is less or equal to 1.There are different methods to choose the pivot point, such as random, middle or last element for each rotation.

Each algorithum has two key function (quickSortB and quicksort). quicksort chooses the size of the array for each rotation, and quickSortB chooses the pivot point and perform quick sort of the array.
